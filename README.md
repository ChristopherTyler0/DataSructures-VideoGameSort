# DataSructures-VideoGameSort
COP3530 Final Project


This was created to be the final project for my Data Structures and Algorithm class.

The project was to create any program using any data set as long as the program used two different algorithms to sort the data
and compare the results/execution times.

Originally, the project was supposed to be a group project, but both of my group members dropped the class, so I worked on it by myself.
